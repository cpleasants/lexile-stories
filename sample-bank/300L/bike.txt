Jack was on his bike. He was fast! Jack's dog Rex ran past Jack. Rex was fast, too. Rex ran in Jack’s path. “Stop, Rex!” Jack said. “Get off my path!” But Rex did not stop. He did not get off Jack’s path. Jack did his best to stop so he did not hit Rex. Jack fell! He fell on his fist in the dust. Now Jack has a cast on his fist. Jack can not get on his bike with a cast on his fist. He can not run. He just has to sit and rest. “Mom! I can not just sit and rest,” Jack says. But Mom says it is best to rest the fist.
