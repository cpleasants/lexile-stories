Chicken Big and Chicken Little have two chairs, a big chair and a little chair.
"Who will get the big chair?" said Chicken Little.
"Who will get the little chair?" said Chicken Big.
"Let us play a game," they said. "One, two, three, go!"
Chicken Big chased Chicken Little across the room.
Chicken Little sat in the big chair.
Chicken Big cheered and clapped her wings.
Chicken Little got up. She chased Chicken Big.
Chicken Big sat in the little chair.
Chicken Little cheered and clapped her wings.
But all of a sudden, the little chair creaked, croaked, and it broke!
Chicken Big crashed to the ground.
Chicken Little ran to her friend. "OK, Chicken Big?" She said. 
Chicken Big checked her wings. She checked her legs. She nodded her head.
"OK Chicken Little," she bravely said.
"Then let's play another game," said Chicken Little.
"One, two, three, go!" And off they ran.
Chicken Little ran to the big chair.
Chicken Big ran to the big chair.
They sat down together and, as far as I know, they are sitting there still.
The end.
