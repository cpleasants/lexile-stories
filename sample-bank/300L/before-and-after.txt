Peg wants a snack.
Before a snack, Peg will wash her hands.
Then, yum, a stack of pancakes!
After the snack, Peg can play ball.
Ted wants a swim. Before the swim, Ted will test the pool.
Then, ahhh, a dip in the pool. 
After his dip, Ted sits in the sun.
Bill will go to bed. Before he gets in bed, he puts on his pj's.
Then, a soft kiss from Mom. After the kiss, Bill can sleep.
The End.
