Tam and Miss Kim met to jog. The pals jog a lot. Can Jen jog and run? Jen said, “I bet I can”! The gal pals jet up the hill. Miss Kim had a lot of pep and will hum and rap. Tam is set to gab. Jen can not zip up the hill. Run, Jen, run! Will Miss Kim and Tam pass Jen? Jog up the hill Jen! Huff, puff, huff! Jen sat on the log to rub her leg. Jill is a wet mess. Miss Kim and Tam tell Jill it is O.K. Jill said, “It is not fun to run”.
