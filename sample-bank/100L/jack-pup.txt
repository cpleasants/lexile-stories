Jack got a pup! The pup is Rex. Rex is a good pup. Rex and Jack are buds. Rex gets a hug. Jack gets a kiss. “Not on the lips, Rex!” A pup has to nap a lot. Rex has a nap in the tub. Rex has a nap on the cat bed. And Rex has a nap on Jack’s bed. But Mom will not let Rex nap on Mom’s bed. “Off, Rex! Get off the bed!” Rex can not nap on Mom's bed!
