Six tomcats it on the Tip top of a big wall.
The sun will set soon.
"E-ow, E-ow, E-ow," all of the cats call. "Meow, meow, meow," they all squall.
Max, who is six, sits up in a tree.
"Hey, cats," calls Max, "what do you see?"
But the cats meow is all they will tell.
After a time the sun did set.
As night fell, the cats called, "Max, we see a big white ball."
Max looked up at the light as he sat in the tree. "What a wonderful sight," said he.
Then, as Max sat looking at the big white moon, suddenly he saw a man looking back at him.
The man in the moon saw six cats and Max. "What a wonderful sight tonight," said he. Soon the bright light of the moon was over them all. 
Then the six tomcats did begin to call and call and call.
"Me-ow, re-ow, bre-ow," they sing to Max and to the man on the moon.
Max was glad he was in the tree to see the moonlight and to hear the song.
But at last the moon man went out of sight. The song was over until another date.
Go to bed, Max.
Go to bed, six tomcats.
Good night, Max. Good night, Cats.
Good night, moonlight.
The end.
