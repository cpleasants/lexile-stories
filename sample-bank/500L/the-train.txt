The little train was painted black.
When it ran, its wheels went clickety-clack, clickety-clack.
It had a big brass bell that went ding-dong, ding-dong.
It ran on tracks that were both shiny and strong.
The little train ran in the rain.
It ran in the sun.
It ran up the hill and down the hill.
It went from town to town.
But one day a funny thing made a little train stop.
On the track was a big brown cow!
"Toot, toot, toot. Ding-dong, ding-dong," was all in vain.
It was plain that the cow was not afraid. She just stood and looked and wagged her tail.
"Get off, brown cow," The trainman yelled.
"Shoo! Shoo!" "Moo! Moo!"
"What can we do?" the passengers said. "We paid our fare but we cannot go anywhere!"
Soon a little maid came along with a shiny pale.
She sat down on a stool next to the cow.
As the cow wagged her tail and mooed at the train, the maid pumped milk into the pale.
Then the maid got up, gave a little bow. She went off down the track with the old brown cow.
At last the little black train started to move. "Toot! Toot! Ding-Dong!" It's saying. Every day it went from town to town, but the little maid and the old brown cow were never seen again.
The End.
