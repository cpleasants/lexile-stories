Buck is a gull. He has a pack to lug his snacks. Buck sits on a dock next to his flock, but his flock mocks his pack. His flock pecks at the pack. His pals ask if the pack gives him a crick in his neck. Buck gets mad and hops off the dock.
Buck hops for blocks, but his tum gets sick. Buck must stop to pick at his snack. Buck sits on a stack of sticks and rocks, but the sticks and rocks sit on top of a pit. Buck slips into the pit! A big rock drops on his pack, and Buck is stuck! Buck kicks at the rock. He pecks at the rock. He smacks the rock.
Just as Buck gives up, his flock plucks him from the pit. His pals hug him and help him back to the dock. Buck is glad to be back on the dock. His flock clacks, “It was bad for us to mock the pack. It is odd for a gull to lug a pack, but odd is not bad. It is a grand pack!”
