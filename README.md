# lexile-stories
## Summary
You add a topic or prompt, along with a desired lexile level, and a story will be generated at that approximate lexile level. Right now, the range is BR300L to 410L

## How does this work?
On the back end are examples at various Lexile levels. The examples demonstrate to the LLM how writing at those levels look. LLMs _do not_ have a fundamental understanding of the lexile levels, no matter what it might tell you, so examples has been the simplest way I have come up with to describe them accurately.

## Future improvements
Perhaps adding length? The examples will likely influence the length of the story.
